<p class='warning padded'>It was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0veqgr7lw4o">recently announced</a> that the phrase "Levelling up" will no longer be used by the Government. The department responsible will now be known as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.</p>
<p>
    This page shows local-authority-level data on successful bids for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-fund-first-round-successful-bidders">Round 1</a> (2021) and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-fund-round-2-successful-bidders">Round 2</a> (2022-3) of Levelling Up funding from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.

<p>
    This map shows the funding of successful bids in rounds one and two of Levelling Up, divided by the population of that local authority (funding per capita).
    Where a bid was successful, we have attempted to match the name of lead applicant organisation to a local authority.
    In some cases, the lead organisation covers multiple local authorities. In this instance, we divide the grant funding equally 
    across all local authorities that the lead organisation could feasibly claim to cover. There are some local authorities which did not receive funding in rounds one or two; 
    these are shown with a value of "none".

<p class='warning padded'>
    Important note: the Isles of Scilly and the Shetland Islands have much higher per capita values than the mainland. We have limited the colour scale so that variation elsewhere can be seen.
