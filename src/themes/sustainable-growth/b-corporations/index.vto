    As a B Corp certified business, Brabners is particularly interested in the prevalence of B Corps and 
    owner-managed businesses across the North, who have purpose and mission embedded into the way they operate.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/">B Corp Certification</a> is a designation that a business is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices and input materials. The aggregate data shown on this page comes from <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/">B Labs' dataset</a> and is based on the location of each B Corp's headquarters. We have local authority breakdowns for <a href="#all">all B Corps</a>, <a href="#size">by size of company</a>, <a href="#ownership">by ownership</a>, and <a href="#sector">by sector</a>.</p>
