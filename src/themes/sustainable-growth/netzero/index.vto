	This page shows data for companies in the North of England who are classified under The 
	Data City's Net Zero Real-time Industrial Classification (RTIC). This data allows us to map 
	the Net Zero economy in the U.K, which isn't possible using traditional economic sectors.
	In partnership with the ECIU and CBI economics, The Data City produced  
	a <a href="https://thedatacity.com/blog/new-report-showcases-the-uks-net-zero-economy/">report 
	mapping the net zero economy</a>. We have taken a cut of that data for the North of England and present
	a broad summary of the results below.

    <summary><h3>About this data</h3></summary>
    <p>
        The data on this page was calculated using The Data City's "Net Zero" Real-time industrial classification (RTIC).
        These statistics are estimates calculated using their analyse tool, which has important limitations to be aware of.
        Before interpreting these statistics, please read their blog on 
        <a href="https://thedatacity.com/analyse-using-analyse-for-location-analysis/">how the analysis tool works</a>
        and <a href="https://help.thedatacity.com/knowledge/using-analyse#analysis-summary-box">explanations of the headline statistics</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the Net Zero classification, the following criteria were applied to the list of companies:
        <ul>
            <li>Must have its registered address in any of: the North East, North West, or Yorkshire and the Humber (ITL1 regions).</li>
            <li>Up to 250 employees.</li>
            <li>Up to £10 million annual turnover.</li>
            <li>Exclude <a href="https://help.thedatacity.com/knowledge/what-are-companies-with-potential-anomalies">outliers</a>.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Employee counts by local authority</h3>

    Important note: A company can be in multiple sectors. When that happens, we can't say exactly 
    how many employees work in each of the sectors. Therefore, the number shown is the number of 
    employees at companies that operate at least partly in the Net Zero RTIC.
